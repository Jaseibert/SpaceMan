# SpaceMan

Space man is a python package that accomplishes several unique tasks within the space of Astrodynamics. The package gives users the ability to parse satellite Two-Line Element (TLE) Data into its Ballistic, Keplerian, and Identifying elements. Beyond, this SpaceMan uses a `Matplotlib` 3D plotting toolkit to plot the trajectory and orbit of the satellites relative to the earth.
