Sprint 1: Create MVP Modules with Basic functionality (Done)
    - Build a module to parse the different components within the TLE.
    - Build a module to that will infer additional orbital elements from
      the parsed TLE information.
    - Build a module that uses the Orbital information to plot the orbit around
      a sphere.
    - Create project README.md

Sprint 2: Optimize and Improve on the Basic Modules (Done)
    - Create a module with a few example satellites to test.
    - Add print functionality to the TLE parsing, and the Draw orbit functions.
    - Optimize the 3D UI.
    - Start on a Document that explains the current functions in relation to
      orbital mechanical concepts.

Sprint 3: Build out Analytics Capabilities
    - Create functions that find each of the individual components in a TLE.
    - Eliminate the larger functions that parse and return multiple elements.

Sprint 4: Add Space-Track and CelesTrak API support
